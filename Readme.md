===============================

Donato Giovannelli
-------------------

This is a mini workshop organized at in my Department to give a very basic introduction to sequence analysis in microbial ecology and microbiology.

A word of caution...
---------------------

I am **not** an expert in Bioinformatic. This workshop is meant to be practical not comprehensive. This workshop will only give you a head start. We have all a long way to go to be accurate in our analyses. Keep improving using google and online tutorials.


Topics covered:
---------------

* Shell: the very basics
* 16S rRNA sequence analysis
* QIIME: Basic analysis
* Genomic and comparative genomic: a primer
* Transcriptomic in prokaryotes
